A Cesarean birth, also known as abdominal birth, belly birth, C-section, cesarean, caesarean section, or caesarean delivery is a surgical procedure to deliver a baby through incisions in the mother's abdomen and uterus. It can be planned in advance due to medical reasons or occur unexpectedly during labor. While generally safe, it's a major surgery with potential risks and a longer recovery period compared to vaginal birth.
